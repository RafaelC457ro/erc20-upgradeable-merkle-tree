# Solidity Channel Exercise

This is my implementation of the follow exercise:

> You will have to code an ERC20, that is upgradeable. Another contract, which we will call the Airdrop contract, will control the ERC20â€™s minting. Obviously, the Airdrop contract should use a Merkle tree to determine who is able to claim its airdrop.
> On top of that, contracts should be upgradeable (be sure to check the upgradeable OpenZeppelin library).
> Bonus points for upgrading one of them too.
